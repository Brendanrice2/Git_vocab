## Vocab Notes

-Git - VCS (Version control system) 
-GitHub - Git's easy to use online interface
-Repository - essentially a project folder
-Cloning - Used to make local edits to a repository, and then push them later on. Easy for experimenting
-Commit - Step 1 of making changes to the remote repository. Commits come with helpful messages to inform others what you changed
-Push - Used to change the current remote repository, assuming the changes made in the commits within won't infere with code alreay written
-README - Used to describe what's going on in a project, I.E. what the project is about.
-Branch - Separate copy of a repository, used to fix bugs and make changes that will later be merged into the main branch if the changes applied are satisfactory
-Fork - Another way of copy a repository, used more often when building off of someone else's work.
-Pull Request - Used to show others what changes you're proposing on making to the main branch. This is how we are being graded in this class, is through making PRs from our badge branches
-Issues - Essentially tasks that one must keep up on within the repository. This is where our badges are going to be presented in class this year.
